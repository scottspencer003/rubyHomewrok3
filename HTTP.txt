What is the difference between an HTTP GET request vs a POST request?

Both commands are HTTP methods for requesting information. A GET requests data from a specific source where all the information for the request is contained in the URL. Meanwhile a POST command submits data to be processed to a specified source and can contain info for the request for the server in the message body.

Some other differences to note:

GET method
	-Parameters for the search remain in history because it is based on the URL
	-Can be bookmarked
	-Is less secure and more easily hacked.
	-Should not be used to send passwords.


POST method	
	-Parameters are not saved in browser history
	-Can not be bookmarked
	-More difficult to hack making it a little safer to send ifo such as passwords.
